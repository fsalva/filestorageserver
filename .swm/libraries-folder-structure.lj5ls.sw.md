<br/>

Include the header files you need in your code!

<br/>

## Source Files

<br/>

Source files ar contained in the `ðŸ“„ libs/src` , they are needed to build artifacts!

<br/>

## Artifacts

Artifacts are needed to compile the code and have all the functions ready to be called!

<br/>

When compiling add those to the Makefile!

<br/>
